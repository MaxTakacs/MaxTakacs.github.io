About Me:

My name is Max Takacs, I am a student at California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo.  I am majoring in
Economics with a concentration in Quantitative Econometrics, graduating Fall 2018.  My classwork and projects
have strongly focused on statistical analysis and modelling, finance, and data analytics.
